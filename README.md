# INTRODUCTION

  In today's dynamic educational landscape, the demand for a comprehensive and user-friendly platform that empowers students has never been more critical. This proposal outlines the creation of a student assistance website that goes beyond traditional study materials.

### **OUR VISION**

  Our vision is to establish a vibrant online community that connects students, fosters collaboration, offers personalized tutoring, facilitates virtual study sessions, and assists in effective study schedule management. The core theme of the website, "Learning Network Nexus," underlines our commitment to student success through collective support and accessible resources.

# MARKET RESEARCH OVERVIEW

  In guidance for this initiative, sizable marketplace research was conducted. This evaluation involved careful evaluation of current educational structures and scholar support web sites, including Khan Academy, Coursera, and StudyBlue. By figuring out user alternatives, layout trends, and important functions, we've got distilled valuable insights that guide our challenge's direction. Additionally, a survey was administered to University of Pretoria students, soliciting insights into their support requirements, 20 random students doing various courses filled our survey. The data gathered from this survey played a pivotal role in shaping the project's approach and identifying the 5 functional requirements.

# FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND JUSTIFICATION

1. Availability of online video tutorials and study resources
2. Academic support by means of study groups and peer collaborations
3. Assistance from alumni on a specific module student is struggling on
4. Collaboration amongst students whereby they can form study groups
5. Collaboration amongst students whereby they can form study groups.

# 1st & 2nd FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT

  ![1691954077876](image/README/1691954077876.png)

  Our First functional requirement is The availability of online video tutorials and study resources, These received 70% and 65% in terms of how students prefer to seek academic help and support, thus this will be a feature supported on our Website.

  Our second functional requirement is based on the fact that 65% of students seek academic support by means of study groups and peer collaborations hence we included it as a requirement.

# 3rd FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT

  ![1691954098736](image/README/1691954098736.png)            ![1691954213125](image/README/1691954213125.png)

  Our third functional requirement is based on 75% of the students responding yes to receiving help from alumni students who have excelled in the modules they require help with and 25% said maybe, due to no student responding No and a higher percentage of Yes, access to online tutors with reputable results in the modules they wish to tutor would be a functional requirement.

# 4th FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT

  ![1691954247233](image/README/1691954247233.png)

  Because 70% of students want to participate in study groups, we have incorporated a dashboard as part of the functional requirements to track progress, schedule meetings, and view progress on quizzes.

# 5th FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT

  Our fifth functional requirement is based on 85% of students responding that they would want problem-solving practice exercises so our website will support this as well by providing access to practice material and exercises.

# EXISTING PRODUCTS

  To Guide the ideation process we looked at a few existing websites with similar themes and ideas, we also looked at other websites that contain elements we thought would be great to incorporate in the design.

# KHAN ACADEMY

1. **Engaging and Comprehensive Content.**
   Engaging content captures and maintains the attention of students, making the learning experience enjoyable and effective. Comprehensive content covers a wide range of topics, ensuring that students can find the help they need.

   Importance : if the content is dull or incomplete, students will lose interest quickly, leading to limited learning outcomes. By offering a wide variety of engaging and comprehensive materials, students are more likely to stay motivated and achieve better results.
2. **Adaptive Learning Technology.**

   Adaptive learning tailors the educational experience to the individual student's level, pace, and learning style. This personalization improves comprehension and retention.

   Importance : Not all students learn at the same pace or in the same way. Adaptive learning ensures that each student gets a customized learning path, making the experience more effective and efficient. It addresses the diverse needs of learners, enhancing overall satisfaction.
3. **User-Friendly Interface.**

   A user-friendly interface enhances accessibility and ease of use. It reduces frustration and allows students to focus on learning rather than struggling with navigation.

   Importance : A confusing or complex interface can discourage students from using the website. A simple, intuitive design with clear navigation ensures that students can quickly find the resources they need. A responsive layout makes the website accessible on different devices, catering to the preferences and convenience of the users.

# COLOUR CHOICES

  The blue and green color combination is often used in a complementary manner, creating a sense of openness and informality while maintaining a level of seriousness. This blend of colors brings a peaceful harmony that adds a subtle dynamic quality, working together effectively. When aiming to capture learners' attention, this color pairing is useful because it presents serious educational content or services in a more fun and inviting manner, making the overall visual experience less monotonous. To optimize this color scheme on an educational website, it's important to ensure sufficient contrast between the blue and green hues. Source Reference: Verpex Blog, "Best Color Combinations for Educational Websites" (URL: https://verpex.com/blog/website-tips/best-color-combinations-for-educational-websites)

1. Backgrounds: We Opted for a softer, light shade for the background, allowing content to stand out against the soothing backdrop. A pale blue or mint green (#B0E0E6) provides a gentle and inviting canvas.
2. Buttons & Text Links: Utilize a slightly darker or more vibrant shade for buttons and text links, creating a visually appealing contrast that draws learners' attention. A deeper blue or forest green (#006699) can add a touch of seriousness and ensure essential elements are noticed.
3. Lively Green: A shade that conveys energy and freshness while harmonizing with the serene blue background for accents.

# LAYOUT OF THE PAGES

#### General Layout of Pages

  Research shows humans process visuals 60,000 times faster than text, retaining 80% of what they see. Hence, balancing visual and written content is crucial for our website. (﻿Marc Avila 2020).

  To minimize user frustration and improve engagement, we will prioritize important information upfront. This reduces the risk of users leaving due to difficulty finding desired information. (Marc Avila 2020).

  To ensure readability for all users, we will use neat fonts and avoid using light font colors on light backgrounds or pale fonts on dark backgrounds. ﻿(Mike St. Jean 2020).

#### Layout for specific pages

##### Home Page

  Provides a comprehensive overview of its features, including captivating images and engaging elements that highlight study materials, collaboration, tutors, group/course management, and practice resources.

  Offers access to resources like notes and organizes them effectively, and implements a search bar for easy navigation and finding materials for students.

##### Study groups Page

  Has tools for group management, enabling users to create and manage study groups, as well as search for available groups. Will also have a discussion tab for the group members.

##### Alumni/Tutor Page

  This page will list reputable tutors, will include profiles of the tutors including their qualifications, expertise, and reviews from students. It should also provide an easy way for students to contact or book sessions with the tutors.

##### Support & Help Page

  Assists the user with common problems and also has a form that the user can submit to tell us their issue.

# NAVIGATION

#### Navigation Between Pages

  We intend to incorporate a sticky navigation bar on all pages of our website. This feature will ensure that users can effortlessly navigate to different pages, regardless of their scrolling depth on the current page. (﻿Anadia 2019).
